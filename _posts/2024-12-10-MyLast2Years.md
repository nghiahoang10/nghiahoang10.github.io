## Things I have been working on/learning:

The market looks somewhat exhausted/choppy today (at least from my pov) so I want to write something and to look back at my last 2 years. After that sad spring semester in the US, I decided to go back to my home country to try something new. I DM'ed a friend who was working on some projects in crypto market at that time and he agreed to let me join. Looking back at that today, that friend is the one who has the most impact on what I'm doing today. I helped the team with dev jobs including fullstack stuff (React/TS ecosystem, EC2, Lambda), some scripting (TS/Python), and a bit of smart contract (Solidity) work too. Things were a bumpy road for the first 6 months (from June - December 2023) but then we hit something huge right after 2024 NY.


Since that big win, I have been learning different things to make money within the crypto market which include shitcoining, perps trading, and a bit of arbitraging. I will share a bit about my performance here so you can have a wider view. I made decent with shitcoining from Jan to May and lost a lot on perps (longing pepe/eth) during the summer chop. I recovered from all the losses and 9x'ed my port since September. The most memorable win must be the Hyperliquid airdrop which I was not early but with my technical background, I figured out this is a big thing and started farming and got a fat airdrop a week ago.


I will aggregate some important points I learned in the last 2 years later woohoo (I was about to finish it but needed to arrange my thoughts better)

## Interactions with people:

I haven't had any meaningful relationship/friendship since I started doing crypto things. One of the reasons is that I have been spending all my time on coding/trading stuff, reading other people's thoughts, and chatting with people I respect in crypto. My relationship with my parents is somewhat the same or maybe looser since I don't afford spending that much time with them (both financially and emotionally). This post [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) hit me really hard the other day AHHHHHHHHHHH. 


I'm lucky enough to be friend/work with one of the smartest/kindest person I've met. I learned infinitely many things from that friend and probably can't express my gratefulness enough (I'm so bad at this wtf).


I have been thinking about the breakup 2 years ago recently too. Even though the break up has almost no effect on my life/work, it still stings me a bit sometimes when I think about it. Therefore, whenever I have some free time, I usually try to find the reason myself. Last week, I fell off a motorbike while driving my American friend up the mountain which gave me even more free time. I feel like I somehow nailed the cause. I think the fastest way for someone to move on from their last intense relationship is to start another meaningful relationship as soon as they end one. However, I’m not a fan of that method and that harmed my emotions somehow. It became worse when ex partner chose that way. In my opinion, it's completely normal and I was even happy about it. The problem was with me which is that I felt depressed/unprotected from the thought of ex partner went for a revenge about the split (can be phrased as "the depression that ensues if you don’t go with that way can leave you unprotected from the sense of guilt or energy it takes you to defend yourself in case the ex partner is vindictive about the split" ehhhh).


Anyways, met some extremely smart/funny crypto friends in the last 2 years which is great and I'm still trying to make more crypto friends :pepe_clap:
