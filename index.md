I'm an undergrad at Purdue University studying computer science and mathematics. My interests lie in distributed systems, algorithms, languages and blockchain.

When I'm not learning technical things. I enjoy watching videos of natural landscapes and wildlife scenes. I love seas, rivers, streams, waterfalls...:\)
